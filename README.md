# Hi there! 👋 I'm Ralph Pilapil

I'm a fresh BSIT graduate open to any role in tech from web development to data analytics. I'm passionate about learning new tools, solving real-world problems, and making meaningful contributions through code and data.

## What I Do

During my academic journey, I discovered a strong interest in both front-end development and turning raw data into actionable insights. I enjoy building clean, user-friendly interfaces and analyzing datasets to support smarter decisions.

### Tech & Tools I Use
- **JavaScript**
- **Kotlin**
- **Node.js**
- **React.js**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib),(FastAPI)**
- **SQL**
- **Excel / Google Sheets, Tableau / PowerBI for data analysis**

## Favorite Project

My **capstone project** combined creativity and technical skills, it was a full-stack web and android application built to streamline internal workflows and improve user experience. It gave me hands-on experience in both system design and user-centric development.

## Recent Interest: Data Analytics

Lately, I’ve been diving into data analytics, working with real-world datasets to uncover trends, visualize insights, and tell compelling stories through data. I'm currently exploring:
- Cleaning & transforming data using Python and Pandas
