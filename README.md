- **TailwindCSS**
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)**
- **SQL**
- **Excel / Google Sheets for data analysis**

## ðŸŒŸ Favorite Project

My **capstone project** combined creativity and technical skills â€” it was a full-stack web application built to streamline internal workflows and improve user experience. It gave me hands-on experience in both system design and user-centric development.

## ðŸ“Š Recent Interest: Data Analytics

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into data analytics â€” working with real-world datasets to uncover trends, visualize insights, and tell compelling stories through data. I'm currently exploring:
